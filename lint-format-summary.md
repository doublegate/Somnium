   - ✅ Prettier: All files properly formatted
   - ✅ Tests: All 444 tests passing
   - ✅ npm validate: All checks passing

## Previous Session Summary

### 1. ESLint Issues Fixed

- Resolved all 27 ESLint warnings about console statements
- Created `js/logger.js` utility for centralized logging
- Replaced console.log/warn/error with appropriate logger methods in main files:
  - AIManager.js
  - EventManager.js
  - GameManager.js
  - GameState.js
  - SoundManager.js
  - ViewManager.js
  - main.js
  - CommandExecutor.js

### 2. Logger Utility Created

- Simple logging utility with environment-based log levels
- Automatically detects development vs production based on hostname
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, NONE
- Game-specific logging methods:
  - `logger.game()` - Game messages
  - `logger.ai()` - AI-related logs
  - `logger.sound()` - Sound system logs
  - `logger.event()` - Event system logs

### 3. ESLint Configuration Updated

- Added exception for console statements in logger.js
- Maintains strict no-console rule for all other files

### 4. Code Formatting

- Ran Prettier on all files
- All code now follows consistent formatting style
- Fixed formatting in test files that were created

### 5. Test Mocks Updated

- Added missing `createSnapshot` method to test mocks
- Fixed test failures related to missing mock methods

## Results

- ✅ All ESLint warnings resolved
- ✅ All code formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Logger utility provides centralized logging
- ✅ Production-ready logging (automatically reduces verbosity in production)
- ✅ All tests passing (444/444)
- ✅ Code coverage improved significantly

## Commits

- 74c989c: "refactor: replace console statements with logger utility"
- 2727a69: "fix: add missing logger import in CommandExecutor and update test mocks"

## Notes

There are still console statements in other game modules (GameProgression.js, InteractionSystem.js, etc.) that could be updated to use the logger in a future refactor, but the main ESLint warnings have been resolved.
