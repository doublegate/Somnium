## Running the Demos

All demos are self-contained HTML files that can be run directly in a web browser. However, due to CORS restrictions with ES6 modules, you need to serve them through a local web server.

### Quick Start

From the project root directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Then navigate to:

- http://localhost:8080/demos/[demo-name].html

### Alternative Methods

Using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Using Node.js http-server:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

## Demo Controls

Most demos include on-screen instructions. Common controls:

- **Parser demos**: Type commands and press Enter
- **Graphics demos**: Click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts
- **Sound/Music demos**: Click to play sounds, adjust sliders for parameters
- **Game demos**: Use arrow keys for movement, type commands for actions

## Technical Notes

- All demos use the same core engine modules from the `js/` directory
- Graphics are rendered to a 320Ã—200 canvas (scaled 2x for display)
- Sound synthesis uses the Web Audio API via Tone.js
- Demos are designed to work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Creating New Demos

To create a new demo:

1. Copy an existing demo HTML file as a template
2. Import the required modules from `../js/`
3. Add demo-specific initialization and UI
4. Place the file in this `demos/` directory
5. Update this README with the new demo information

Remember to use relative paths:

- CSS: `href="../css/styles.css"`
- JS modules: `from '../js/ModuleName.js'`
