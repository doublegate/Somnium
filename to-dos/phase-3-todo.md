- [x] Add state-changing interactions
- [x] Create puzzle mechanics
- [x] Implement locked/unlocked states

### Movement System

- [x] Enhance room navigation
- [x] Add blocked exit handling
- [x] Implement conditional exits
- [x] Create movement animations
- [x] Add pathfinding for NPCs

## Phase 3.4: Game World Logic ✅ COMPLETE!

### Puzzle System ✅

- [x] Create puzzle state tracking
- [x] Implement multi-step puzzles
- [x] Add puzzle hints system
- [x] Create puzzle reset mechanisms
- [x] Implement puzzle rewards

### NPC Interactions ✅

- [x] Create NPC inventory/trading
- [x] Implement NPC reactions

### Game Progression ✅

- [x] Create scoring system integration
- [x] Implement achievement tracking
- [x] Add game completion detection
- [x] Create multiple ending support
- [x] Implement save points

## Phase 3.5: Testing & Polish ✅ COMPLETE!

### Comprehensive Testing

- [x] Create parser test suite
- [x] Build command execution tests
- [x] Test all verb implementations
- [x] Create puzzle solution tests
- [x] Integration testing with UI

### Demo Content

- [x] Create sample game world
- [x] Implement demo puzzles
- [x] Add sample NPCs
- [x] Create demo storyline
- [x] Build showcase scenes

### Documentation

- [x] Update parser documentation
- [x] Create command reference
- [x] Document puzzle creation
- [x] Write NPC scripting guide
- [x] Update API references

## Completion Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:

1. Natural language parser fully processes player input
2. All standard adventure game commands work
3. Puzzle and game logic systems are functional
4. NPCs can be interacted with
5. Complete demo game is playable
6. All tests pass
7. Documentation is updated

## Notes

- Focus on Sierra-style parser compatibility
- Ensure all commands feel responsive
- Parser should handle common typos gracefully
- Error messages should be helpful, not frustrating
- Demo content should showcase all features
