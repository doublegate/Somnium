# Phase 3: Parser and Game Logic TODO

**Status**: Ready to Start  
**Started**: Not yet  
**Target Completion**: TBD

## Overview

Implement the natural language parser and core game logic systems that allow players to interact with the game world through text commands.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Phase 1: Core Architecture (Complete)
- [x] Phase 2: Graphics and Sound Systems (Complete)

## Phase 3.1: Natural Language Parser

### Core Parser Implementation

- [ ] Enhance Parser.js with full vocabulary system
- [ ] Implement verb/noun recognition with patterns
- [ ] Add synonym expansion system
- [ ] Create abbreviation handling (l=look, x=examine, etc.)
- [ ] Implement pronoun resolution ("it", "them")
- [ ] Add multi-word verb support ("pick up", "look at")
- [ ] Create preposition handling
- [ ] Implement article filtering

### Vocabulary System

- [ ] Create comprehensive verb list
- [ ] Build object/item vocabulary
- [ ] Implement direction commands
- [ ] Add special command handlers (save, load, quit)
- [ ] Create context-sensitive parsing

### Parser Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all parsing functions
- [ ] Test synonym resolution
- [ ] Test abbreviation expansion
- [ ] Test pronoun context
- [ ] Integration tests with game commands

## Phase 3.2: Command Execution Engine

### Command Processing

- [ ] Enhance EventManager command execution
- [ ] Implement all standard verbs (look, take, use, etc.)
- [ ] Add movement command handling
- [ ] Create inventory command system
- [ ] Implement object interaction logic

### Game Logic Integration

- [ ] Connect parser output to EventManager
- [ ] Implement command validation
- [ ] Add permission/possibility checks
- [ ] Create error message system
- [ ] Implement command history

### Response Generation

- [ ] Create response message formatting
- [ ] Implement dynamic text generation
- [ ] Add context-aware descriptions
- [ ] Create failure message system

## Phase 3.3: Game Mechanics

### Inventory System

- [ ] Enhance inventory management in GameState
- [ ] Implement item weight/size limits
- [ ] Add container objects
- [ ] Create item combination logic
- [ ] Implement worn items system

### Object Interactions

- [ ] Create interaction matrix
- [ ] Implement use X on Y logic
- [ ] Add state-changing interactions
- [ ] Create puzzle mechanics
- [ ] Implement locked/unlocked states

### Movement System

- [ ] Enhance room navigation
- [ ] Add blocked exit handling
- [ ] Implement conditional exits
- [ ] Create movement animations
- [ ] Add pathfinding for NPCs

## Phase 3.4: Game World Logic

### Puzzle System

- [ ] Create puzzle state tracking
- [ ] Implement multi-step puzzles
- [ ] Add puzzle hints system
- [ ] Create puzzle reset mechanisms
- [ ] Implement puzzle rewards

### NPC Interactions

- [ ] Create NPC dialogue system
- [ ] Implement conversation trees
- [ ] Add NPC movement patterns
- [ ] Create NPC inventory/trading
- [ ] Implement NPC reactions

### Game Progression

- [ ] Create scoring system integration
- [ ] Implement achievement tracking
- [ ] Add game completion detection
- [ ] Create multiple ending support
- [ ] Implement save points

## Phase 3.5: Testing & Polish

### Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Create parser test suite
- [ ] Build command execution tests
- [ ] Test all verb implementations
- [ ] Create puzzle solution tests
- [ ] Integration testing with UI

### Demo Content

- [ ] Create sample game world
- [ ] Implement demo puzzles
- [ ] Add sample NPCs
- [ ] Create demo storyline
- [ ] Build showcase scenes

### Documentation

- [ ] Update parser documentation
- [ ] Create command reference
- [ ] Document puzzle creation
- [ ] Write NPC scripting guide
- [ ] Update API references

## Completion Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:

1. Natural language parser fully processes player input
2. All standard adventure game commands work
3. Puzzle and game logic systems are functional
4. NPCs can be interacted with
5. Complete demo game is playable
6. All tests pass
7. Documentation is updated

## Notes

- Focus on Sierra-style parser compatibility
- Ensure all commands feel responsive
- Parser should handle common typos gracefully
- Error messages should be helpful, not frustrating
- Demo content should showcase all features
