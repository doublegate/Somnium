# Somnium v2.0: Multiplayer Adventures Await!

**Published**: June 18, 2025
**Author**: Somnium Development Team

---

We're thrilled to announce the release of **Somnium v2.0** – our biggest update yet! This release transforms Somnium from a single-player AI adventure engine into a fully-featured multiplayer platform with cloud features, comprehensive tooling, and production-ready infrastructure.

## 🎮 What is Somnium?

Somnium is an AI-driven graphical text-adventure game inspired by Sierra On-Line's classic SCI0-era games (1988-1989). Every playthrough generates a completely unique adventure with original puzzles, characters, and storylines – all while maintaining authentic retro aesthetics:

- **320×200 EGA graphics** with 16-color palette
- **Vector-based rendering** with authentic dithering patterns
- **Text parser interface** with natural language understanding
- **Procedural sound and music** using Tone.js synthesis

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

### Multiplayer Co-op Adventures

Play together with friends in real-time! Our new multiplayer system features:

- **WebSocket-based real-time synchronization** – Actions appear instantly for all players
- **Three game modes**:
  - **Co-op**: Work together toward shared goals with team victory
  - **Competitive**: Race to finish with individual scoring
  - **Shared World**: Persistent world for asynchronous exploration
- **Session browser** with password-protected private sessions
- **Built-in chat system** for player communication
- **Up to 8 players per session**

**How it works**: One player creates a session, others join via session ID. Everyone explores the same AI-generated world together, solving puzzles and experiencing the story as a team!

### Cloud Saves & Cross-Device Play

Never lose your progress! v2.0 includes:

- **Cloud save storage** with unlimited slots
- **Secure authentication** with encrypted passwords
