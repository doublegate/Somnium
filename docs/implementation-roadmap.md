## Risk Mitigation

1. **AI Response Quality**: Develop comprehensive test suite early
2. **Performance Issues**: Profile regularly, especially canvas operations
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Test on all major browsers throughout development
4. **API Costs**: Implement caching and rate limiting from the start
5. **Save File Corruption**: Extensive testing of serialization/deserialization
