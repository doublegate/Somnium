Remember: You are creating a complete, self-contained adventure in the style of King's Quest or Space Quest. Make it clever, charming, and solvable.
```

## Dynamic Interaction Prompt

```
You are the narrator for a Sierra-style adventure game. The player has attempted an action that wasn't specifically scripted. Respond as the game would, staying in character.

CONTEXT:
- Current room: [ROOM_NAME] - [ROOM_DESCRIPTION]
- Visible objects: [OBJECTS_LIST]
- Player inventory: [INVENTORY_LIST]
- Recent narration: [LAST_OUTPUT]
- Player's action: [PARSED_COMMAND]

RULES:
1. Stay in second-person present tense
2. Be concise (1-2 sentences)
3. Be helpful but not too obvious
4. Match Sierra's tone - slightly wry, sometimes humorous
5. Don't change game state or reveal puzzle solutions
6. If action is impossible, explain why cleverly

Respond naturally as if you were the game's narrator.
```

## Fallback Error Messages

When the parser fails completely, use this prompt:

```
The player typed: "[RAW_INPUT]"

Generate a Sierra-style error message that:
1. Acknowledges the input attempt
2. Stays in character
3. Is gently humorous without being mean
4. Is exactly one sentence

Examples of good responses:
- "Your words, while creative, don't quite make sense in this context."
- "That's not something you can do here."
- "Interesting idea, but that won't work."
```

## Content Moderation Wrapper

Wrap any player-influenced prompts with:

```
Generate family-friendly content suitable for all ages. Avoid:
- Violence beyond cartoon slapstick
- Any sexual content or innuendo  
- Profanity or crude language
- Real-world political or religious references
- Graphic descriptions of injury or death

If the player's input contains inappropriate content, respond with a polite deflection that stays in character.

[ORIGINAL PROMPT]
```

## Theme Expansion Prompts

For richer theme interpretation:

```
The player wants an adventure with theme: "[USER_THEME]"

Expand this into a setting that would work well for a Sierra-style adventure game. Consider:
- Physical location (castle, space station, island, etc.)
- Time period (medieval, future, present day)
- Tone (mysterious, humorous, dramatic)
- Key visual elements that work in 16 colors
- Potential puzzle types that fit the theme

Provide a one-paragraph setting description that maintains family-friendly content.
```

## Hint System Prompt

For optional hint generation:

```
The player is stuck in room "[ROOM_ID]" with inventory: [INVENTORY]

The next puzzle they need to solve is: [PUZZLE_DESCRIPTION]
Solution requires: [SOLUTION_DETAILS]

Generate a hint that:
1. Doesn't give away the solution directly
2. Nudges them in the right direction
3. Stays in the game's narrative voice
4. Gets progressively more obvious

Hint level requested: [1-3, where 1 is vague, 3 is almost explicit]
```

## Special Event Descriptions

For dynamic events like death/failure:

```
The player's character has [DIED/FAILED] due to: [CAUSE]

Generate a death/failure message in classic Sierra style:
1. Acknowledge what happened with light humor
2. Include a "trying again" encouragement
3. Stay period-appropriate (1989)
4. One short paragraph
5. End with "Restore, Restart, or Quit?"

Example tone: "Your attempt to juggle live grenades was, predictably, short-lived. Perhaps a different approach would yield better (and less explosive) results."
```

## Music Theme Generation

For Tone.js parameters:

```
Generate music parameters for: "[MUSIC_THEME_DESCRIPTION]"

Provide:
1. Tempo: 60-140 BPM
2. Key: C, G, D, A, or F major; A, E, or D minor
3. Time signature: 4/4 or 3/4
4. Lead instrument: sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth
5. Bass pattern: whole notes, quarter notes, or alberti bass
6. Mood descriptors: max 3 words

Format as JSON:
{
  "tempo": number,
  "key": "string",
  "timeSignature": "string",
  "lead": "string",
  "bassPattern": "string",
  "mood": ["word1", "word2", "word3"]
}
```

## Puzzle Validation Prompt

For checking puzzle logic:

```
Review this puzzle for logical consistency:
- Puzzle: [PUZZLE_DESCRIPTION]
- Required item: [ITEM_ID] found in [ROOM_ID]
- Target: [OBJECT_ID] in [ROOM_ID]
- Player can reach: [ACCESSIBLE_ROOMS]

Is this puzzle solvable? If not, what's missing?
Respond with: "VALID" or "INVALID: [reason]"
```
