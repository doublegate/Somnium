# Somnium

An AI-driven graphical text-adventure game inspired by Sierra On-Line's SCI0-era games (1988-1989). Every time you play, the AI generates a completely unique adventure with its own story, puzzles, and world.

  - Vector-based graphics rendering with 9 dithering patterns
  - Dynamic MIDI-style music generation with multiple sound presets
- **Complete Game Systems**:

  - Full inventory system with weight/size constraints and containers
  - Multi-step puzzle system with hints and rewards
  - NPC dialogue trees with relationship tracking
  - Trading system for merchant interactions
  - Achievement and scoring system
  - Multiple endings based on player choices
- **Save Your Dreams**: Complete save/load system preserves your unique generated worlds
- **Intelligent Interactions**: Unscripted actions handled dynamically by AI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, or Edge 80+)
- OpenAI API key or compatible LLM service
- Node.js and npm (optional, for development server)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doublegate/Somnium.git
cd Somnium
```

2. Create a `config.js` file in the `js/` directory:

```javascript
export const API_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: 'your-openai-api-key-here',
  apiEndpoint: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
};
```

3. Start a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx http-server -c-1 .
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

5. Click "New Adventure" and optionally enter a theme (e.g., "haunted castle", "space station")

## How to Play

### Basic Commands

- **Movement**: `go north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `up`, `down`
- **Interaction**: `look`, `look at [object]`, `take [item]`, `use [item] on [object]`
- **Communication**: `talk to [character]`, `ask [character] about [topic]`
- **Inventory**: `inventory` or `inv`

### Tips

- Examine everything - descriptions often contain clues
- Save your game frequently (F5)
- The parser understands many synonyms (e.g., "get" = "take" = "grab")
- If stuck, try exploring other areas or talking to characters

### Building from Source

Currently, Somnium runs directly from source with no build step required. Simply serve the files from a web server.

### Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

See [Test Suite Documentation](tests/README.md) for details on writing and running tests.
